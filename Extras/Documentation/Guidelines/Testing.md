# Testing and Validation

Relevance: include this file for all projects where code changes can be validated by tests, linters, formatters, or build checks.

## Why this file exists

This module defines baseline expectations for proving behavior changes and reporting validation status clearly.

## Baseline Expectations

- Add tests for new behavior and bug fixes where practical.
- Prefer focused unit/integration tests over heavy end-to-end tests unless the risk requires full-stack coverage.
- Follow existing repository testing style unless there is a clear reason to improve it.

## Validation Workflow

1. Run narrow checks closest to the change first.
2. Run broader project checks next.
3. If project validation scripts exist, use them.
4. If scripts are missing or fail, run equivalent manual checks.
5. If validation cannot run, report exactly what was not validated and why.

## Test Design Guidance

- Test through stable interfaces where possible.
- Keep tests explicit and readable.
- Extract shared test helpers only when they improve clarity.
- Cover edge cases and failure modes touched by the change.

## Reporting Guidance

When summarizing work:
- list what checks were run
- list what checks were skipped
- call out meaningful residual risk from skipped validation
